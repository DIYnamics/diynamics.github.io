<p><strong>Jordyn Moscoso</strong> (<span class="caps">NSF</span> Postdoctoral Research Fellow, <span class="caps">UC</span> Santa Cruz,
Department of Ocean Sciences)<br> Jordyn Moscoso began her time with
DIYnamics focused on incorporating hands-on demonstrations into
undergraduate and graduate curriculum at <span class="caps">UCLA</span>. While much of her
initial efforts were working directly with rotating tank
demonstrations, she recently expanded beyond individual demos to
incorporate active learning techniques across broader student-led
learning. Her primary goal with DIYnamics is to make essential
concepts in earth and climate science tangible through
discovery-focused activities. Currently, Jordyn is an <span class="caps">NSF</span> Postdoctoral
Research Scholar at <span class="caps">UC</span> Santa Cruz. Her research focuses on the impact
of wildfires on phytoplankton blooms in the California Current System.

<h2>Team members (in alphabetical&nbsp;order)</h2>
<p><img src="/images/people/ankit-barik.jpg" width="200" title="Ankit Barik" alt="Ankit Barik"></p>
<p><strong>Ankit Barik</strong> (Postdoc, Johns Hopkins University)<br></p>
<p>Ankit is a postdoc at Johns Hopkins University and works on
simulations of planetary interiors and magnetic fields.  He got
interested in DIYnamics because of a live demo of the Lego kit by Jon
Aurnou and Noris Khoo at the <span class="caps">AGU</span> Fall Meeting in 2018.  He loved the
fact that even a theoretician like himself could now perform small
scale fluid dynamics experiments at home without the need for
expensive&nbsp;equipment.</p>
<p><img src="/images/people/mirjam-glessmer.jpg" width="200" title="Mirjam Glessmer" alt="Mirjam Glessmer"></p>
<p><strong>Mirjam Glessmer</strong> (oceanographer and science communicator)<br>
Mirjam introduced #KitchenOceanography in her oceanography classes
back in 2011 as a way to give students the opportunity to see
phenomena right in front of them instead of only describing them
mathematically, and to help them practice observational, discussion
and lab skills, using only materials that are available in most
kitchens. Discovering the DIYnamics rotating tables meant that
students could now even manipulate and observe the influence of
rotation on large-scale ocean circulation, which Mirjam has introduced
in Dynamics of the Atmosphere and Ocean classes in both Kiel (Germany)
and Bergen (Norway).  <a href="https://mirjamglessmer.com/">Link to Mirjam&#8217;s&nbsp;website</a></p>
<p><img src="/images/people/alex-gonzalez.jpg" width="200" title="Alex Gonzalez" alt="Alex Gonzalez"></p>
<p><strong>Alex Gonzalez</strong> (Assistant Professor, Dept. of Geological and
Atmospheric Sciences, Iowa State University)<br> Alex joined the
DIYnamics project in September 2019. He loves using rotating tanks in
the fluid dynamics classes he teaches at <span class="caps">ISU</span>. His goal is to
transition to placing more focus on applications rather than theory in
his classes. He is excited about using the DIYnamics’ rotating tanks
in outreach activities to inspire a new generation of scientists,
especially those from underrepresented <span class="caps">STEM</span> groups. <a href="https://tad.ge-at.iastate.edu/">Link to Alex’s
<span class="caps">ISU</span> Research Group&nbsp;webpage</a></p>

<p><strong>Alex Chen</strong> (Undergraduate, <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Deptartment of Computer Science) <br>
Alex developed the third generation&nbsp;of <code>DigiPyRo</code>, with emphasis on speed and
accessibility. His work allows students to play with rotating reference frames
and gain intuition for the Coriolis force by simply visiting a&nbsp;website.</p>
<p><img src="/images/people/david-james.jpg" width="200" title="DJ James" alt="DJ James"></p>
<p><strong>David (<span class="caps">DJ</span>) James</strong> (PhD student, <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Department of Earth,
Planetary, and Space Sciences) <br> <span class="caps">DJ</span> has reanimated the DigiPyRo&nbsp;(now <code>diyrotate</code>) Python script to work in Python 3.  This script
digitally rotates a movie around a selected axis point.  This allows
students to experiment with the Coriolis acceleration by selecting
their own digitally rotating reference frame, and is proving to be an
excellent tool for a number of different DIYnamics exercises.  He is
starting his PhD work with Prof. Lars Stixrude at <span class="caps">UCLA</span> in the fall of&nbsp;2020.</p>

<h2>Event Volunteers and DIYnamics&nbsp;users</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the core team members are just the tip of the DIYnamics
iceburg!  What matters most is how much the DIYnamics materials get
used &#8220;in the wild&#8221; by teachers, students, and science communicators,
in classrooms, exhibits, public events, and on and&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="/pages/blog.html">blog</a> for posts on various events
that the Core Team and other groups have put on using the DIYnamics
materials.  Those posts provide shout outs to the main people involved
and supporting cast for each&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Are you using DIYnamics in your class or science outreach event?  We
would love for you to guest-author a Field Report post on it!  It can
be as short as a couple paragraphs or as long as you wish.  The more
pictures the better, and we can even include videos by uploading them
to our YouTube page and embedding them within the post.  Just shoot us
a message at <a href="mailto:diynamicsteam@gmail.com">diynamicsteam@gmail.com</a>
and we&#8217;ll work with you to get it&nbsp;posted!</p>
