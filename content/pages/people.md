**Alex Gonzalez** (Assistant Professor, Dept. of Geological and
Atmospheric Sciences, Iowa State University)<br> Alex joined the
DIYnamics project in September 2019. He loves using rotating tanks in
the fluid dynamics classes he teaches at ISU. His goal is to
transition to placing more focus on applications rather than theory in
his classes. He is excited about using the DIYnamics’ rotating tanks
in outreach activities to inspire a new generation of scientists,
especially those from underrepresented STEM groups. [Link to Alex’s
ISU Research Group webpage](https://tad.ge-at.iastate.edu/)

**Jordyn Moscoso** (Graduate student, UCLA Dept. of Atmospheric and
Oceanic Sciences)<br>Jordyn is a graduate student in the Atmospheric
and Oceanic Sciences department studying oceanography and ocean
dynamics. She is excited to be a part of the DIYnamics team and is
working to bring DIYnamics into the curriculum in the AOS
department. She is also a member of the Society of Women Geoscientsts
and uses DIYnamics to give hands on experiences to women, girls, and
people of other classically underrepresented genders in STEM.


{% img {static}../images/people/henry-gonzalez.jpg 200 Henry Gonzalez %}

**Henry Gonzalez** (SPINLab Project Manager, UCLA Dept. of Earth,
Planetary, and Space Sciences)<br>Henry Gonzalez is currently serving as
the SPINLab Project Manager and Space Magnetism Lab Manager,
developing/coordinating everything from spacecraft instruments to
geophysical fluid dynamics experiments.  His extensive knowledge in
prototyping has paved the way to new modeling systems for
understanding the interiors and atmospheres of planets.  Furthermore,
he is working on the Henry III (H3) Model which will be a portable
geoshysical system that will be used for classroom teaching of
advanced concepts as well as outreach at public events and interactive
K-12 STEM demonstrations.


{% img {static}../images/people/taylor-lonner.jpg 200 Taylor Lonner %}

**Taylor Lonner** (UCLA Geophysics-Astrophysics dual B.Sci. 2020) <br>
Taylor specializes in the design and production of many of the
rotating tank systems used by the DIYnamics team.  Working with the
engineers at MiniTec (www.minitecframing.com), she designs systems
that can be ordered in sets and assembled by universities and
institutions without requiring additional machining or power tools.
This work is essential to the DIYnamics project’s main goal of making
fluid dynamics experiments accessible and affordable in classrooms and
lecture halls around the world.


{% img {static}../images/people/david-james.jpg 200 DJ James %}

**David (DJ) James** (PhD student, UCLA Department of Earth,
Planetary, and Space Sciences) <br> DJ has reanimated the DigiPyRo
Python script to work in Python 3.  This script digitally rotates a
movie around a selected axis point.  This allows students to
experiment with the Coriolis acceleration by selecting their own
digitally rotating reference frame, and is proving to be an excellent
tool for a number of different DIYnamics exercises.  As a side
project, he is starting his PhD work with Prof. Lars Stixrude at UCLA
in the fall of 2020.


{% img {static}../images/people/marianna-linz.jpg 200 Marianna Linz %}

**Marianna Linz** (Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences,
Harvard University) <br> Marianna is an atmospheric dynamicist and
physical oceanographer. Her research focuses on large-scale
geophysical fluid dynamics and transport. Current work in her group
includes quantifying the stratospheric circulation from satellite
data, explaining the detailed shape of midlatitude temperature
distributions, and most recently, environmental effects on
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Marianna got her PhD from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution Joint Program in Physical Oceanography and was a
postdoctoral research fellow at UCLA in Atmospheric and Oceanic
Sciences. She is passionate about
[teaching](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2019/12/studying-storm)
and [outreach](https://www.scienceclubforgirls.org/), and wrote a
[children's picture book about climate

## Alumni

{% img {static}../images/people/Sean.png 200 Sean Faulk %}

**Sean Faulk** (Student, David Geffen School of Medicine,
UCLA)<br>Sean helped write the lab instructions and organize the first
outreach trips for the DIYnamics project.  As a Ph.D. student in the
UCLA Dept. of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, he studied
climates on other planets and moons, most of all Saturn's moon Titan.
And he loved going out to schools to play with rotating tanks and help
students learn about planetary atmospheres!  After finishing his
Ph.D. in 2018, Dr. Faulk made the leap from outer space to human
bodies, as he is now pursuing his M.D. as a medical student at the
UCLA Medical School.

## Event Volunteers and DIYnamics users

Ultimately, the core team members are just the tip of the DIYnamics
iceburg!  What matters most is how much the DIYnamics materials get
used "in the wild" by teachers, students, and science communicators,
in classrooms, exhibits, public events, and on and on.

Check out our [blog](/pages/blog.html) for posts on various events
that the Core Team and other groups have put on using the DIYnamics
materials.  Those posts provide shout outs to the main people involved
and supporting cast for each one.

Are you using DIYnamics in your class or science outreach event?  We
would love for you to guest-author a Field Report post on it!  It can
be as short as a couple paragraphs or as long as you wish.  The more
pictures the better, and we can even include videos by uploading them
to our YouTube page and embedding them within the post.  Just shoot us
a message at [diynamicsteam@gmail.com](mailto:diynamicsteam@gmail.com)
and we'll work with you to get it posted!

## Origin story

The idea for DIYnamics came from Jon Aurnou's Simulated Planetary
INteriors Lab (a.k.a. SPINLab), in the UCLA Department of Earth,
Planetary, and Space Sciences.  SPINLab has been conducting outreach
using rotating tanks for years, but Jon was yearning for a cheap,
portable version of the equipment that people without the equipment
(and budget) of his highly specialized lab could easily attain.  There
was (and still is) MIT's excellent Weather in a Tank platform, but
that costs several thousand dollars and requires custom assemply.

Work began in earnest in 2016 within SPINLab, and late in that year
Spencer, Juan, and Sean joined the fold.  But it really took off in
early 2017 when, due to a scheduling snafu, Norris got stuck observing
one of our meetings and --- essentially on the spot --- came up with
the LEGO-based design that was far superior to the wood-based
prototype we were working on up to then.  Within days we had a working
prototype that is, with only a few modest tweaks, the DIYnamics
LEGO-based table.
