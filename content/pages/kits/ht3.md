## What is the HT3 Table?

The HT3 Table is a specially designed system including a large rotating tank, lightweight frame, and multi-functional cart that is meant to optimize geophysical fluid dynamics demonstrations while remaining accessible and portable. This high-end device is ideal for demonstrating simple to advanced geophysical fluid processes, and can be easily stored and moved between locations. The custom tank is designed to maximize its diameter while still fitting through a standard door frame. The heart of the HT3 Table is the THC (Taylor-Henry Cart), a rolling cart designed to be low to the ground such that young children can easily watch demonstrations, and transportable between classrooms and buildings. Featuring large locking casters and an adjustable handlebar, the cart is comfortable to push along a variety of terrain, and when the wheels are locked, the handlebar stows under the table to allow for 360 degrees of view.
