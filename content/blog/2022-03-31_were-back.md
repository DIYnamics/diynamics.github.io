Hello world!  It's been almost a year since our last post, but rest
assured the DIYnamics team has not sat idly by in that time period.
If anything we have been busier working toward our dream of getting
rotating tanks in every science classroom worldwide.  And we've got a
number of exciting posts queued up describing recent events and some
upcoming ones.  So this post is just a quick preview of all those.

First, this coming Wednesday, April 6th, we will host our first-ever
   public Show and Tell session.  It will be via Zoom, and please take
   <1 min to register so that we can send you the Zoom link directly.
   We've been doing these internally for a couple years now, and
   they've been a blast!  We want to open it up to the broader
   community so that others can share what they've been up to
   DIYnamics-wise: questions/problems they've had, cool demos they've
   gotten working, recent events, etc.  Join us! Here's the poster:

Second, our next post will be a [Field Report]({category}Field Reports)
   written by Isabelle Bunge, Ph.D. student at Columbia University, who
   used our Lego table in her guest teaching activities in the New York
   Unified School District!

Third, we are putting on a 2-day workshop on teaching with rotating tanks
   at this July's Earth Educators Rendezvous conference in the Twin
   Cities, MN!  We'll have more details soon, but for now here's the
   [link](https://serc.carleton.edu/earth_rendezvous/2022/program/morning_workshops/w9/index.html) to the workshop page with more info.  We encourage anybody
   interested to sign up!  And we may have funding support for travel
   and registration.
