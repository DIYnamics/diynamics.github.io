their relevance to the behavior of planetary fluid bodies. Over the
course of two poster sessions, we had the opportunity to share our
educational tools with dozens of conference attendees from diverse
backgrounds._

On December 11 and 13, 2018, the DIYnamics team presented at the Fall
2018 meeting of the [American Geophysical Union](https://sites.agu.org/) (AGU). AGU, currently
celebrating its 100th anniversary, annually holds the largest
geoscience conference in the world. Norris, Spencer and Jon had a great
experience spreading the word about DIYnamics and listening to feedback
from members of the geoscience community - including some who are
already using our materials!

_Norris sharing the household items necessary to create your own
geophysical fluid dynamics model. The goal of DIYnamics is to promote
geoscience education by making physical models, a useful tool for
studying large scale real world phenomena, as accessible as possible._

AGU provided a unique opportunity to share DIYnamics with individuals
from institutions around the world. During our poster sessions, we
prepared demonstrations centered around the DIYnamics table - a fun
logistical challenge 2,500+ miles away from home! We showed how
physical models of planetary fluid bodies can be constructed using
household items, whether they be LEGOs + a turntable for our rotating
table or a frozen can for our cold source. These accessible tools
allow audiences at all levels to observe the fluid dynamics behind
weather, ocean circulation and more providing tremendous educational
benefit!

be conducted with readily available resources and the number of
"recipes" continues to grow._

At the conference, we conducted experiments highlighting solid body
rotation, mechanically generated vortices and baroclinic instability.
For the big picture, we hope that our physical models help individuals
think analytically when approaching real world phenomena. Models are
integral to science because they simplify and facilitate the study of
complex systems.

_After placing rheoscopic fluid in a rotating tank, we observed an
interesting pattern of spirals arranged in concentric circles. This
can be attributed to rotating convection, prompted by differences in
temperature at the top and bottom of the fluid body, resulting in the
formation of columnar structures (spirals are their surface manifestation).
The concentric circle arrangement occurs because the bottom of the
tank features similar ridges._

The DIYnamics team was amazed by [Borrero-Echeverry et al. (2018)'s](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5045053)
"do-it-yourself" rheoscopic fluid made using Barbasol shaving cream.
Rheoscopic fluid contains small particles suspended in water and
allows audiences to track the flow of fluid. At AGU, we greatly
enjoyed talking with individuals who share our passion for outreach
and hearing stories of the DIYnamics table in use! As more people
adopt our system, we are excited to see what experiments the
community has in store!

Thank you to the AGU for providing a platform to share DIYnamics, the
EPSS Strauss Family Fund for Undergraduate Opportunity for supporting
Norris' first conference visit and last but not least, the conference
attendees who came to our poster and provided their valuable feedback.
