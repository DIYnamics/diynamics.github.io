      <p><em>[Note from Spencer: This post written by Linden Ashcroft is part of
our ongoing <a href="/blog/category/field-reports.html">Field Reports</a> series, where
DIYnamics users across the country&#8212;-and in this case, the
world(!)&#8212;-share how they&#8217;ve used the DIYnamics kit and materials in
local&nbsp;communities.]</em></p>
<p>Thanks to some teaching funding from our faculty, my colleagues and I
have been able to bring DIYnamics Down Under in&nbsp;2022!</p>

<p><em>One student&#8217;s photo of their experiment using the DIYnamics&nbsp;kit!</em></p>
<p>We have used the DIYnamics rotating tanks in undergraduate teaching
this semester to introduce how rotating fluids behave. In combination
with a fish tank and some creative alternatives for online students,
we explored the impact that rotation and temperature gradients had on
our atmosphere and&nbsp;oceans.</p>
<p>Most of the practicals in our class are computer-based, so working
with potentially messy equipment was a thrill for me and the
students. It was also a highlight for the class to conduct in-person
experiments after two years of online&nbsp;learning.</p>
<h2>Step by&nbsp;step</h2>
<p>The experiment was designed so the students could explore the
different elements of our atmosphere step by step. In the first stage,
a temperature gradient was set up in a fish tank, using food dye to
show the flow of cold water underneath warmer water, before
overturning and eventually&nbsp;mixing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/melbourne-2022/melbourne1.png" width="600" title="Melbourne 1" alt="Melbourne 1"></p>
<p><em>Stage 1: A non-rotating temperature gradient. Ice was placed at one
end of the tank, and we let this experiment run during the entire&nbsp;practical.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/melbourne-2022/melbourne2.png" width="600" title="Melbourne 2" alt="Melbourne 2"></p>
<p><em>Stage 1, at home edition. For students working online, they were
invited to do the same thing with kitchen supplies. Students didn’t
find milk or tea to be great tracers, so they used dye, soy sauce and
soft drink instead. Introducing different fluid densities added
another element of&nbsp;complexity!</em></p>
<p>Stage 2 asked the students to consider how a stationary fluid behaves
by delivering drops of food dye into a non-rotating vase of water. In
stage 3, we added rotation, following the generous instructions of
Mirjam Glessner. Some students struggled to wait for solid body
rotation, but those who did were rewarded with clear vertical&nbsp;structures.</p>

<p><em>Set up in a makeshift teaching space, as our labs were being&nbsp;renovated!</em></p>
<p>Finally, we added a temperature gradient, by placing ice
in the middle of the tanks. This was a real kitchen science
experiment, with tea leaves and old jam jars acting as crucial&nbsp;equipment!</p>
<p><img src="/images/melbourne-2022/melbourne4.png" width="600" title="Melbourne 4" alt="Melbourne 4"></p>
<p><em>Students in&nbsp;action</em></p>
<h2>Lessons learnt (by&nbsp;us)</h2>
<p>We were impressed by the self-led experiments the students conducted
after completing the structured part of the practical. Using the
app-driven motors enabled the students to easily vary the speed of
their tanks and see what that did to eddy generation. Some groups
tried different temperature variations, to see what would happen with
warm water in the tanks, rather than room temperature water. Finally,
being in the Southern Hemisphere, some groups had to explore what
would happen if the tanks rotated in the other&nbsp;direction!</p>
<p>Beautiful pictures and videos were submitted as part of the practical
assessment, and almost all students told us they enjoyed the
class.  However, in a post experiment survey, only two thirds of the
students felt the activity improved their understanding of the
atmosphere’s behaviour. That means there’s room for improvement, which
is great because I am excited to play with the equipment again next&nbsp;year.</p>
